1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model to provide a reference from a
   termination point in a topology model to interface management
   information.  It introduces a way to reference the information in a
   YANG data model for interface management [RFC8343] that could be
   useful for all types of termination points.  The model augments "YANG
   Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies" defined in
   [RFC8795], which is based on "A YANG Data Model for Network
   Topologies" defined in [RFC8345].

   The interface reference model is expected to be used between a
   Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) and a Multi Domain Service
   Coordinator(MDSC) [RFC8453].  Different use cases require access to
   different attributes and in order not to restrict what use cases can
   be supported, all attributes supported by the interface management
   model is with this model made accessible from the topology model.

1.1.  Terminology and Definitions

   The following acronyms are used in this document:

   PNC Provisioning Network Controller

   MDSC Multi Domain Service Coordinator

1.2.  Tree Structure

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   chapter 3.1 of this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define schemas for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The YANG module specified in this document imports and augments the
   ietf-network and ietf-network-topology models defined in [RFC8345].
   The security considerations from [RFC8345] are applicable to the
   module in this document.

   There is a data node defined in this YANG module that is
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  This data node may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to this data node without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  This is the data node
   and its sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  tp-to-interface-path: A malicious client could set an arbitrary
      path that could allow a client to retrieve incorrect information.
      Troubleshooting would be difficult because the bad path would not
      be detectable until the client tries to use the leaf to identify
      to radio link terminal.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a new URI from the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688] as follows:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tp-interface-reference-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   It is proposed that IANA should record YANG module names in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] as follows:

    Name: ietf-tp-interface-reference-topology
    Maintained by IANA?: N
    Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tp-interface-reference-topology
    Prefix: ifref
    Reference: RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  Examples of the application of the Topology Model

   This appendix provides some examples and illustrations of how the
   Interface Reference Topology Model can be used.  There is one
   extended tree to illustrate the Model and a JSON based instantiation
   of the Interface Reference Model for a small network example.

A.1.  A tree for a complete Interface Reference Topology Model

   The tree below shows the leafs for extending a Network Topology Model
   defined in [RFC8345], Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies model
   defined in [RFC8795] with a possibility to reference interface
   management information.
   
   module: ietf-network
     +--rw networks
        +--rw network* [network-id]
           +--rw network-id                network-id
           +--rw node* [node-id]
              +--rw node-id               node-id
              +--rw nt:termination-point* [tp-id]
                 +--rw nt:tp-id           tp-id
                 +--rw tet:te!
                    +--rw ifref:tp-to-interface-path?  -> /if:interfaces/interface/name
